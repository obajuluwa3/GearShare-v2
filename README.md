## Skills & Lessons Learned

* Experimented with Angular Material for front end UI
* Used CSS flex-box techniques to organize layout
* Building databases and tables using PostgreSQL
* Built a server application with routes and password encryption and authentication using Ruby and Sinatra 
* Created a client application using Angular and utilized components and two-way data binding
* Connected server and client and enabled user to update and interact with information stored in database through client views

## Possible further development..
* Most of the front-end so far is just flex-box CSS, I would love to rebuild the whole thing using more Angular Material
* There are still some functionality glitches that need to be worked out, I will keep working to straighten them out
* Devloping and deploying the app on a mobile platform using React Native or a hybrid framework such as Ionic
* Adding picture uploading functionality for equipment
